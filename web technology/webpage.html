    <p style="color: blueviolet;"><i>A web page (or webpage) is a document on the Web that is accessed in a web browser. </i> </p>
    <p> A website typically consists of many web pages linked together under a common domain name. 
        The term "web page" is thus a metaphor of paper pages bound together into a book.</p>
